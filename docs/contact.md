**Example Feature Request**:
```markdown
## Feature Request: Cross-compilation Support

### Use Case
Build Slurm packages for ARM64 clusters from x86_64 build machines

### Proposed Solution
Add `--target-arch` option to specify target architecture:
`uv run slurm-factory build 25.05 --target-arch arm64`

### Alternatives Considered
- Building directly on ARM64 (slow, expensive)
- Using emulation (very slow)

### Examples
- Docker buildx multi-platform builds
- Cross-compilation in other package managers
```
